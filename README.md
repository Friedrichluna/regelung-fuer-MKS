This repo contains a codebase intended to visualize functions used by 
Klaus Janscheck in Mechatronische Systeme / Regelung von Mehrkörpersystemen.
In particular the writing style with {d_0, w_0} = s^2/w_0^2 + 2*d_0*w_0*s + 1 
can be used as sop(d_0, w_0) (see template for example use).

The main goal is to use python instead of matlab so you don't need 
to wait 5min for it to start.
